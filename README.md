# Blackjack-game
Built this game while learning javascript. Made my fundamentals strong with 
if else statements
loops
objects
JS methods
and logical operators

Also learnt to utilise Chrome api and togglr developer's mode in chrome Extensions section.
This is the first chrome extension I built and utilised in my Local system.
